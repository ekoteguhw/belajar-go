/**
To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.
Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.
We can then execute the built binary directly.

$ go run hello.go
Hello Go!

$ go build hello.go
$ ls
hello	hello.go

$ ./hello
Hello Go!
